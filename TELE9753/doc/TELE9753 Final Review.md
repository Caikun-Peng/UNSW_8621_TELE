# Everything you need to know about the EXAM

1) Although the topics are given here, you will need a solid grasp of other concepts as well, in particular the GSM, CDMA, OFDM, and parameters in these techniques. You will still get questions that require calculating and using some of those formulas or understanding the Rayleigh fading, the Gaussian components in the complex form, AWGN, modulations, etc.
2) The example questions below are limited. You can attempt any other questions related to the “scope of the question" for each topic, including the ones available in the homework and tutorial questions.
3) You need to revise your notes carefully, in particular the parts that cover the “scope of the question” defined below.

# Course Objective

- Past four decades have seen a surge of research activities in 
  the field of wireless communication.
- Emerging from this research thrust are new points of view on 
  how to communicate effectively over wireless channels. 
- The goal of this course is to study in a unified way the 
  fundamentals as well as the new research developments.
- The concepts are illustrated using examples from several 
  modern wireless systems (GSM, IS-95, CDMA 2000 1x EV-DO, 
  Flash OFDM, LTE, 5G.)

## Week 1: An Overview of Digital Communications

### Typical Wireless Communication system

Transmitter: generates information (“source”)

Channel: propagation medium (destination)

Receiver: processes information (“sink”)

### Analog vs. digital communication systems

Analog - source is a continuous-time waveform

Digital - source is a digital a.k.a., binary sequence

Both analog and digital communication systems actually send a continuous-time waveform.  
The difference is the source.  

Digital communication uses a finite number of possible waveforms.

### Digital communication systems

### Overview

- Why Digital Communication?
    
    Hardware cheap, reliable
    
    Lower power and cost
    
    Suitable for digital data
    
    Simplifies networking, layering, and standardized binary interface
    
    Easy to change + reconfigure

### Analog to Digital Converter

Convert the source signal into a binary  
sequence  

Sampling: Capture the values at the sampling rate (sampling rate >Nyquist rate)

Quantization: Mapping continuous infinite values to a smaller set of discrete finite  
values;  

Binary coding: Mapping the discrete finite values into bit sequences.

### Encryption and decryption

Encryption: convert the source binary sequence into another binary sequence that is hard to understand by an unintended recipient

Decryption: Remove encryption to make the transmitted signal readable for the intended  
sink  

### Source Coding

Compress binary sequences to minimize the number of transmitted bits (can be lossless or lossy)

- **Huffman coding**
- **Source Coding Theory**

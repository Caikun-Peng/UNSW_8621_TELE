1.  What general information is included in an energy diagram for a particular material system? What are the general aspects and factors that contribute to formation of the energy diagrams?

> > [Lec_2, 8](<2. PHTN4662 Lecture 2 FIbre Amplifiers and Lasers.md#energy-level-diagram>)
>   - General Information:  
>       Energy Axis, Energy Levels, Transitions and Labels
>   - General Aspects:  
>       - Ground State: The lowest energy state of the system.
>       - Excited States: Higher energy states that the system can occupy after absorbing energy.
>       - Activation Energy: The energy required to transition from one state to another.

2.  What is Boltzmann distribution? What are the key factors in determining the distribution for energy state population? Under what conditions can this distribution be valid? Under what conditions can this distribution be substantially violated? 

> > [Lec_2, 7](<2. PHTN4662 Lecture 2 FIbre Amplifiers and Lasers.md#interaction-between-matter-and-light>)
>   - Boltzmann distribution   
>       It describes the distribution of particles among various energy states in a system at thermal equilibrium.
>       $$\rho=\exp(-\dfrac{E}{kT})$$
>   - Key Factors in Determining the Distribution for Energy State Population
>       - Energy Levels $E$
>       - Temperature $T$
>       - Boltzmann Constant $k$
>   - Conditions for the Validity
>       - Thermal Equilibrium: The system must be in thermal equilibrium, meaning the temperature is uniform throughout the system.
>       - Classical Limit: The distribution applies to systems where quantum effects are negligible.
>       - Non-Interacting Particles: Particles should not significantly interact with each other, as interactions can alter energy states.
>    - Conditions Leading to Substantial Violation
>       - Non-Equilibrium Systems: Systems not in thermal equilibrium e.g., rapidly changing systems or those with external energy inputs.
>       - Strong Interactions: In systems where particles interact strongly the simple Boltzmann distribution may not apply.

3.  What are fundamental processes involving light and matter interaction? What are their basic characteristics?

> > [Lec_2, 5-6](<2. PHTN4662 Lecture 2 FIbre Amplifiers and Lasers.md#interaction-between-matter-and-light>)
>   - Fundamental processes: Absorption and Emission
>   - Absorption
>       - Energy Transfer: Light (photons) is absorbed by matter, transferring energy to the electrons or other particles within the material. 
>       - Electronic Transitions: In atoms and molecules, absorption can cause electrons to transition from a lower energy level to a higher one (excited state). 
>       - Selective Wavelengths: Absorption occurs at specific wavelengths corresponding to the energy difference between the electronic states. 
>   - Emission
>       - Spontaneous Emission: When electrons in an excited state return to a lower energy level, they release energy in the form of photons. 
>       - Stimulated Emission: External photons induce electrons in an excited state to drop to a lower energy level, emitting additional photons with the same phase, frequency, and direction. 
 
4.  How is 'absorption' linked to 'excitation' in a light and matter interaction?

>   - Energy Transfer:
>       - Absorption: When a material absorbs light (photons), it takes up the energy of the photons.
>       - Excitation: The absorbed energy is used to promote electrons within the material to higher energy states.
>   - Electronic Transitions:
>       - Absorption: Photons with specific energies (corresponding to particular wavelengths) are absorbed by the material if their energy matches the energy difference between the initial and excited states of electrons.
>       - Excitation: The electron transitions from a lower energy state (ground state) to a higher energy state (excited state) due to this absorbed energy.
>   - Wavelength:
>       - Absorption: The absorption of photons at specific wavelengths leads to an absorption spectrum, which shows dark lines or bands at these wavelengths. This spectrum is characteristic of the material and provides information about the energy levels and electronic structure.
>       - Excitation: The wavelengths at which absorption occurs indicate the energy levels to which electrons are excited.
 
5.  What is a 'radiative transition'? What is a 'non-radiative transition'? Where the released energy goes in a 'radiative transition'? Where the released energy goes in a 'non-radiative transition'?

> > [Lec_2, 8](<2. PHTN4662 Lecture 2 FIbre Amplifiers and Lasers.md#energy-level-diagram>)
>   - Radiative Transition
>       - A radiative transition is a process where an excited electron returns to a lower energy state, and the excess energy is released in the form of a photon (light).
>   - Non-Radiative Transition
>       - A non-radiative transition is a process where an excited electron returns to a lower energy state without emitting a photon. Instead, the excess energy is dissipated through heat (IR).
 
6.  What is the life time of an energy level? When an energy level is referred as a metastable level?

>   - Lifetime of an Energy Level
>       - The lifetime of an energy level refers to the average time an electron or particle remains in that energy state before transitioning to a lower energy state. 
>   - Metastable level
>       - when it has an unusually long lifetime compared to other excited states.
 
7.  What is optical amplification? 

>   Optical amplification is a process by which the power of an optical signal is increased without converting it to an electrical signal. This is achieved by using a medium that amplifies the light signal as it passes through.
 
8.  What are basic conditions to build a laser?

20. A Fabry-Parot laser operates at wavelength $\lambda$. The gain medium has an absorption / attenuation coefficient $\alpha$, a gain coefficient $g$ and a refractive index $n$. The F-P cavity of length $L$ consists of 2 mirrors with their reflection coefficients $r_1$ and $r_2$ . Prove that the gain threshold for this laser is $g_{th}=\alpha-\dfrac{1}{2L}\ln(r_1r_2)$ and the longitudinal mode spacing of this laser is $2nL=m\lambda$.

21. The FBG at either end of the 5 cm long Erbium doped optical fibre has a reflectivity of 0.9. The loss coefficient of the optical fibre is 2 dB/m at the laser wavelength region around 1550 nm. If the gain factor of the fibre is 0.1 dB/m per mW of the pump power.

    2. Assume the Erbum doped fibre has a Gaussian spontaneous emission (gain profile), $g(\lambda)$, with a spectral width of 30nm, and the fibre laser operates at the wavelength region around 1550nm, determine how many longitudinal modes will lase if the pump power is 1.1 times of the threshold.

# Optical Components
## Fibre connectors

High precision ceramic ferrules and alignment sleeves have high concentricity at both ends, and very accurate inner and outer diameters
  > ![fibre connector](../images/Com_Structure_Connector.png)
- Low loss connection:
  - High precision ceramic ferrules and alignment sleeves have high concentricity at both ends, and very accurate inner and outer diameters.
  - High precision optical fibres have high core concentricity, and very accurate core and cladding diameters.
  - High quality polished and clean endfaces.
- Connection Types
  - FC: Ferrule Connector  
    - FC Screw 2.5 mm IEC 61754-13 
    - Applications: 
      Datacom, telecom, measurement equipment, single mode lasers; becoming less common
  - FC/PC: Ferrule Connectors typically use a “Physical Contact" polish at the fiber and ferrule end. 
   
    > This is a slightly curved surface, so that when fibers are mated only the fiber cores touch, not the surrounding ferrules. 
  
  - FC/APC: FC with *Angled Physical Contact* or *Angle-Polished Connection*
  
    > These connectors are available with the fiber endface polished at an angle to prevent light that reflects from the interface from traveling back up the fibre. Generally angle-polished connectors have higher insertion loss and is desirabe for system where feedback to  than good quality straight physical contact ones. 

    - Because of the angle, the reflected light does not stay in the fiber core but instead leaks out into the cladding. Angle-polished connectors should only be mated to other angle-polished connectors. Mating to a non-angle polished connector causes very high insertion loss. 

    > APCs are distinguished visibly by the use of a green strain relief boot, or a green connector body.  
    > An angled FC connector may be designated FC/APC, or merely FCA. 
    Non-angled versions may be denoted FC/PC or with specialized designations such as FC/UPC or FCU to denote an "ultra" quality polish on the fiber endface.

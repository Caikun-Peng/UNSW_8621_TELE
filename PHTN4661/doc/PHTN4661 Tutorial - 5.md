- Tutorial 5 Optical waveguide and fibre fabrication

1. What are traditional glass fibre fabrication techniques? What are their advantages and disadvantages? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 4-7)

2. What are key requirements and considerations for low-loss silica optical fibre designs and fabrications? 

    > Designs require low loss, low attenuation, high mechanical strength.  (Lecture 3, page 10)   
    > Fabrication consider the choice of materials, the refractive index profile, and the fabrication process.

3. Why different materials such as GeO2, Al2O3 and B2O3 are used in silica optical fibres? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 8, 12)

4. What are possible reasons that a process of preform fabrication is needed for fabricating low loss silica optical fibres? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 9, 14)

5. What are essential processes in CVD method for fabricating low-loss silica fibre preforms? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 10)

6. Sketch a diagram with simple explanation to illustrate the processes and mechanisms involved in fabricating fibre preform MCVD. 

    > (Lecture 5, page 22)

7. Typical CVD techniques of fabricating silica fibre preforms include MCVD, OVD, OAD and PCVD. Identify their similar and different features? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 17-30)

8. What are general conditions and procedures of drawing silica optical fibres? What are the reasons and considerations behind them? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 9, 29)

9. What are techniques used in fabricating microstructure optical fibres or photonic crystal fibres? 

    > (Lecture 5, page 32)

10. Identify 5 application-specific optical fibres and their respective design features and properties. 

    > (Lecture 5, page 36, 41)

11. What are main requirements and considerations in optical waveguide designs and fabrications? 

    > 

12. List any 3 types of materials for optical waveguides and briefly describe their respective applications. 
 
    > 

13. Usually optical fibre and optical waveguide cores are made with different cross-section shapes, e.g. circle for fibre and square for waveguide. What are possible reasons for the difference? Any possible advantages or disadvantages for making an optical waveguide with a circular core? 

    > 

14. What are usual procedures / processes employed in fabricating a buried planar waveguide? 

    > 

15. List any 5 types of optical waveguide devices, and briefly explain their functions.

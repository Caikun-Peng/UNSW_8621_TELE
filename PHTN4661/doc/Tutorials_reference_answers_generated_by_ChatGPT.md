    A slab waveguide is a simple waveguide consisting of a thin film of high refractive index material sandwiched between two lower refractive index materials. The parameters U, W, and V are defined based on the geometry and refractive indices of the waveguide.

7. What is the fundamental mode of a slab waveguide? 

    The fundamental mode of a slab waveguide is the mode with the lowest order, characterized by a single peak in the field distribution.

8. What is a step-index optical fibre? What is a graded-index optical fibre 

    A step-index optical fibre has a core with a uniform refractive index surrounded by a cladding with a lower refractive index. A graded-index optical fibre has a core with a gradually changing refractive index.

12. Optical intensity of transmitted signal Io, through a material of length z, is related to the incident intensity Ii that follows the inverse exponential power law (usually referred to as Beer–Lambert law): $I(z)=I_ie^{-\alpha z}$. Here $\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient (or linear attenuation coefficient), measured in inverse of length, e.g. $cm^{-1}$ or $1/𝑐𝑚$. Optical glass is of high quality if its attenuation coefficient is less 0.01 $cm^{-1}$. Fused or synthetic silica by any means is extremely transparent and its attenuation coefficient is less 0.00001 $cm^{-1}$. Work out the attenuation coefficients for them in dB/km. (Ans: 4343 dB/km, 4.3 dB/km) 

    $a[\text{dB}/km]=10\log(e^{a[cm^{-1}]})=a[cm^{-1}]10\log(e)=\dfrac{a}{10^{-5}}[km^{-1}]10\log(e)=4.343a\cdot10^{5}[\text{dB}/km]$  
    $a_{0.01cm^{-1}}[\text{dB}/km]=4.343\cdot0.01\cdot10^5=4343\ \text{dB}/km$  
    $a_{0.00001cm^{-1}}[\text{dB}/km]=4.343\cdot0.00001\cdot10^5=4.343\ \text{dB}/km$

13. Give an estimate of the percentage of light that would reach a 1cm, 5cm and 10cm thickness of optical glass if its attenuation is 0.1 $cm^{-1}$. (Ans: 90.5%, 60.7%, 36.8%) 

    $I(z) =I_ie^{-\alpha z}$  
    $I(1) =I_ie^{-0.1\cdot1} =0.905I_i \to 90.5\%$  
    $I(5) =I_ie^{-0.1\cdot5} =0.607I_i \to 60.7\%$  
    $I(10)=I_ie^{-0.1\cdot10}=0.368I_i \to 36.8\%$  

14. Give an estimate of the percentage of light that would reach a 10km, 50km and 100km length of optical fibre if its attenuation is 0.2dB/km. (Ans: 63.1%, 10.0%, 1.0%) 

    $I(z)  =I_i10^{-\alpha z/10}$  
    $I(10) =I_i10^{-0.2\cdot10/10} =0.631I_i \to63.1\%$  
    $I(50) =I_i10^{-0.2\cdot50/10} =0.1I_i   \to10\%$  
    $I(100)=I_i10^{-0.2\cdot100/10}=0.01I_i  \to1\%$  

15. What is microbending of optical fibre? How would it affect the fibre’s transmission? 

    Microbending refers to small-scale bends in an optical fibre, which can cause light to leak out of the core, leading to increased attenuation. It affects transmission by increasing loss, especially in single-mode fibres.

16. What is macrobending of optical fibre? How would it affect the fibre’s transmission? 

    Macrobending refers to large-scale bends, which can also cause attenuation due to the loss of guided modes.   
    It affects transmission by causing additional loss, particularly at wavelengths close to the cutoff wavelength.

17. How microbending would affact a single mode optical fibre? How macrobending would affact a single mode optical fibre? 

    Microbending in a single-mode optical fibre can cause significant loss due to the tight confinement of the mode.   
    Macrobending can lead to cutoff of the mode, resulting in high losse.

18. How microbending would affact a multimode optical fibre? How macrobending would affact a multimode optical fibre? 

    In a multimode optical fibre, microbending can cause mode coupling and differential mode attenuation, while macrobending can lead to loss of higher-order modes.

19. Explain why the critical radius of macrobending, Rc, that introduces high bending loss is quite different for SM and MM optical fibres.

    The critical radius of macrobending (Rc) is different for single-mode (SM) and multimode (MM) fibres due to the different mode structures. In SM fibres, the critical radius is larger because the mode is tightly confined to the core, while in MM fibres, it is smaller due to the presence of multiple modes with different confinement properties.

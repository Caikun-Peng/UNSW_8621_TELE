1. What are usual optical fibre components for optical circuits? 
    > (Lecture 9, page 3) Fibre connectors • Fibre and waveguide couplers • Optical amplifiers • Isolators and circulators • Bragg gratings • Waveguide components • Optical switches, Modulators
1. What are FC/PC, FC/UPC, FC/APC and their main differences? 
    > (Lecture 9, page 8)
1. What are likely problems and proper solutions in using /handling optical connectors? 
2. Briefly explain the operation mechanism of an optical waveguide coupler and its main design parameters. 
3. What are fibre amplifiers? 
    > (Lecture 9, page 27, 28)
4. Briefly explain the operation mechanism of an optical isolator? Using an example to show and explain where it is used? 
5. What is an optical circulator? Using an example to show and explain where it is used? 
6. Briefly explain the operation mechanism of fibre Bragg grating and its main design parameters. What are its main features? (You may need some extracurricular reading) 
7. What is an arrayed waveguide grating? Using an example to show and explain where it is used? 
8. What is an optical switch? Using two examples to show and explain where it is used? 
9. What is an optical fibre Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)? Explain how it can be used as an optical switch or optical intensity modulator. (You may need some extracurricular reading) 
10. Based on your knowledge of optical fibres, discuss likely key issues in fibre connector design and fabrication.
11. Assume you are asked to design a connector for a step-index SMF operating at 1550nm and allowing a maximum insertion loss of 0.5dB. If the connector is specifically for a SMF with the following parameters:
    - Core radius, $a = 5 \mu m$ 
    - Cladding index, $n_{cl} = 1.46$ 
    - Cut-off wavelength, $\lambda_c = 1.24 \mu m$ 

    Calculate the maximum possible tolerance to the core centre offset of the fibre.

1. Assume you are asked to design a connector for a step-index MMF operating at 1550nm and allowing a maximum insertion loss of 0.5 dB. If the connector is specifically for a MMF with the following parameters:
    - Core radius, $a = 50 \mu m$ 
    - Core index, $n_1 = 1.47$ 
    - Cladding index, $n_2=1.46$
    
    Calculate the maximum possible tolerance to the core centre offset of the fibre.

15. A SMF adaptor is used to connect two different step-index SMFs operating at 1550nm with the following parameters:
    - Core radius, $a = 5 \mu m$ 
    - Cladding index, $n_{cl} = 1.46$ 
    - Cut-off wavelength, $\lambda_c = 1.24 \mu m$ 

    If the connectors of these fibres have an axis alignment uncertainty of $\pm3\degree$, calculate the maximum insertion loss due to possible tilt / angle misalignment for a connection between the two fibres.

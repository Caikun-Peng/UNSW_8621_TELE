12. Optical intensity of transmitted signal Io, through a material of length z, is related to the incident intensity Ii that follows the inverse exponential power law (usually referred to as Beer–Lambert law): $I(z)=I_ie^{-\alpha z}$. Here $\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient (or linear attenuation coefficient), measured in inverse of length, e.g. $cm^{-1}$ or $1/𝑐𝑚$. Optical glass is of high quality if its attenuation coefficient is less 0.01 $cm^{-1}$. Fused or synthetic silica by any means is extremely transparent and its attenuation coefficient is less 0.00001 $cm^{-1}$. Work out the attenuation coefficients for them in dB/km. (Ans: 4343 dB/km, 4.3 dB/km) 

    > $a[\text{dB}/km]=10\log(e^{a[cm^{-1}]})=a[cm^{-1}]10\log(e)=\dfrac{a}{10^{-5}}[km^{-1}]10\log(e)=4.343a\cdot10^{5}[\text{dB}/km]$  
    > $a_{0.01cm^{-1}}[\text{dB}/km]=4.343\cdot0.01\cdot10^5=4343\ \text{dB}/km$  
    > $a_{0.00001cm^{-1}}[\text{dB}/km]=4.343\cdot0.00001\cdot10^5=4.343\ \text{dB}/km$

13. Give an estimate of the percentage of light that would reach a 1cm, 5cm and 10cm thickness of optical glass if its attenuation is 0.1 $cm^{-1}$. (Ans: 90.5%, 60.7%, 36.8%) 

    > $I(z) =I_ie^{-\alpha z}$  
    > $I(1) =I_ie^{-0.1\cdot1} =0.905I_i \to 90.5\%$  
    > $I(5) =I_ie^{-0.1\cdot5} =0.607I_i \to 60.7\%$  
    > $I(10)=I_ie^{-0.1\cdot10}=0.368I_i \to 36.8\%$  

14. Give an estimate of the percentage of light that would reach a 10km, 50km and 100km length of optical fibre if its attenuation is 0.2dB/km. (Ans: 63.1%, 10.0%, 1.0%) 

    > $I(z)  =I_i10^{-\alpha z/10}$  
    > $I(10) =I_i10^{-0.2\cdot10/10} =0.631I_i \to63.1\%$  
    > $I(50) =I_i10^{-0.2\cdot50/10} =0.1I_i   \to10\%$  
    > $I(100)=I_i10^{-0.2\cdot100/10}=0.01I_i  \to1\%$  

15. What is micro-bending of optical fibre? How would it affect the fibre’s transmission?

16. What is macro-bending of optical fibre? How would it affect the fibre’s transmission? 

    > (Lecture 3, page 34)

17. How micro-bending would affect a single mode optical fibre? How macro-bending would affect a single mode optical fibre? 

    > (Lecture 3, page 41)

18. How micro-bending would affect a multimode optical fibre? How macro-bending would affect a multimode optical fibre? 

    > (Lecture 3, page 42)

19. Explain why the critical radius of macro-bending, $R_c$, that introduces high bending loss is quite different for SM and MM optical fibres.

# Resource Allocation
## Definition   
  - Resource allocation is the concept of making the best use of limited resources based on the available information.
  - Traditionally, there are four main system design objectives:   
    > cell coverage, cell capacity, energy efficiency, Quality of Service (QoS)  
    - Maximize the cell coverage (number of bits per unit area/volumn (3D))
      - Possible solution: Radiate with maximum power all the time  
          - Increase the multicell interference to other cells -> vicious circle  
          - Results in a very low energy efficiency (in some cases)
    - Maximize the cell capacity (number of bits per Hz)
      - Possible solution: Allocate all the resources to the best user
        - Only one user can be served -> some users are starving -> unfair resource allocation
    - Maximize the system energy efficiency (bit/Joule)
      - Possible solution: Reduce the transmitted power
        - Loss in coverage
        - Cannot guarantee QoS to all users
    - Ensure required QoS such as minimum data rate requirement of a user
      - Possible solution: Allocate all the resources to the user who requires a minimum data rate
        - Results in a very low spectral efficiency if the user is located at the cell edge
        - Some users are starving
        - System resources are under utilized (unfair to the service provider)
## Power Control
  - Basics
    - Guarantee a certain link quality and for interference management
    - To ensure the link quality, it is necessary to maintain the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) of all active users above some threshold
    - Power control algorithm adjusts the transmitted power frequently for achieving this goal
    - SINR may not increase by simply boosting the transmit power of all users
  - Near-far Problem
    - A condition in interference channel
    - A receiver captures a strong signal and thereby makes it impossible for the receiver to detect a weaker signal due to hardware limitation.
  - Cell Breathing Problem
    - A term in describing the variation of the service coverage with respect to the load of the system
    - The traffic in the cell increases, the sensitivity of the BS decreases because of the increased interference
  - Solution: Power control 
    - Power control in interference channels is the adjustment of the transmit power to achieve:  
      - Desired link quality (receiver power level, or SIR)
      - Minimize interference (overall transmit power)
      - Battery saving (less important compared with interference management)
  - Power Control Strategy  
    One strategy for maintaining reliable links for all users is to equalize as much as possible the received power per bit of all users at all times.

# Duplexing and Multiple Access Strategies
## Duplexing
  - Allowing communication in both directions (transmit and receive)
  - Full-Duplex Solution
    - Transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band
    - Advance interference cancellation techniques are adopted to suppress self-interference
    - New technology: There is no commercial product, yet. (only prototypes are available)
  - Half-Duplex Solution
    - Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD): transmit and receive at different frequencies
    - Time Division Duplexing (TDD) – rapidly switch between transmit and receive operations, so it appears seamless to the user receive signal
### Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)
- Transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) at different frequencies concurrently
- FDD provides two simplex frequency channels at the same time for communication.
- A filter can be used to separate Tx and Rx signals
- Frequency separation
  - Frequency separation is large enough such that we can filter out the received Tx signal signal
  - Rule of thumb: 5% of the nominal frequency (in order to use inexpensive duplexer)
- Practical Considerations
  - Isolation often requires in excess of 100 dB
  - Requires a good filter and accurate impedance matching
  - Notch filters are a common choice
### Time Division Duplexing (TDD)
- Provides two simplex time slots on the same frequency for communication.
- Reuse the filters, mixers, frequency sources, and synthesizers, eliminating the complexity and costs associated with isolating the transmit antenna and the receive antenna.
- More flexible than FDD in meeting the need to dynamically reconfigure the allocated upstream and downstream bandwidth in response to customer needs.
- A time latency due to duplexing
## Multiple Access Strategies
### Definition  
A multiple access strategy allows several users to share the available bandwidth
### Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
> ![FDMA](../images/FDMA.png)
- Basics
  - Individual orthogonal channels are assigned to individual users
  - Guard band channels may be needed to avoid adjacent-channel interference
  - FDMA is a continuous transmission scheme
  - If an FDMA channel is not in use, then it sits
idle
- Capacity
  - The number of channel that can be simultaneously supported in a FDMA system is given by  
    $$N = \dfrac{B_t - 2 B_{guard}}{B_c}$$  
    where $B_t$ is the total spectrum allocation, $B_{guard}$ is the guard band allocated at the edge of the allocated spectrum, and $B_c$ is the channel bandwidth.
- Guard bands
  - Performance of channel filters to reject out of band signal
  - Range of signal amplitude variation between channels
  - Out of band spectral occupancy of transmitted signal
- FDMA Advantages
  - Narrow bandwidth channels -> flat-fading -> so no complex receivers (equalizers) required
  - No synchronization overheads (suits uncoordinated users) 
  - Simple, analog circuitry and signal processing(e.g. Frequency modulation)
- FDMA Disadvantages
  - Dedicated channel per user for voice conversation is resource inefficient
    - more 50% of average conversation is silence
  - Guard bands waste spectrum
    - typical 10 − 25% of channel bandwidth
  - Require complex band-pass filters and RF filters to reject adjacent channel interference

### Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
> ![TDMA](../images/TDMA.png)
- Basics
  - TDMA shares a single carrier frequency with several users in a round robin manner
  - Individual orthogonal time slots are assigned to individual users
  - In each time slot, the selected user occupies the entire channel bandwidth
- Capacity
  - The number of channel that can be simultaneously supported in a FDMA system is given by
    $$N = \dfrac{m(B_t - 2 B_{guard})}{B_c}$$  
    where $m$ is the maximum number of TDMA users supported on each radio channel
- TDMA Advantages
  - Low battery consumption due to burst transmissions
  - It is possible to allocate different numbers of consecutive time slots to a user (higher flexility)
  - Duplexer is not required (cheaper hardware)
- TDMA Disadvantages
  - Adaptive equalization is usually necessary in TDMA systems
  - High synchronization overhead is required
  - Guard time is required

### Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
> ![CDMA](../images/CDMA.png)
- Basics
  - A narrowband message signal is multiplied by a very large bandwidth signal (spreading signal)
  - Users use the same frequency and are allowed to transmit simultaneously
  - The power of multiple users at a receiver determines the noise floor (performance)
  - Soft system capacity
- CDMA Advantages
  - Many users of a CDMA system share the same frequency concurrently
  - A channel is released if it is not occupied by a user
  - Soft handoff (make-before-break) can be used to exploit spatial diversity
- CDMA Disadvantages
  - Near-far problem (performance is sensitive to power control)
  - Cell breathing (performance is sensitive to power control)
  - Rake receiver is required to improve reception (exploit multipath diversity)
  - Self-jamming arises from the fact that the spreading sequences of different users are not exactly orthogonal

### Space/Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
> ![SDMA](../images/SDMA.png)
- Basics
  - SDMA controls the radiated energy for each user in space
  - Base station uses the same frequency/different frequencies to serve multiple users simultaneously
  - Static approach: Sectoring; Dynamic approach:
    - Beamforming (adapt to the real-time channel condition)
  - Ultimate goal: To create parallel spatial data pipes (no multiuser interference)
- SDMA Advantages
  - Users can be served concurrently by the same frequency (in TDMA or CDMA) or different frequencies (in FDMA)
  - Spatial degrees of freedom can be exploited for resource allocation (multiplexing and diversity gains)
- SDMA Disadvantages
  - Multiple antennas are needed
  - For adaptive approach, the base station has to keep tracking the status of the time-varying channel -> High signalling overhead
  - May not suitable for small devices
  - Energy consumption for non-radiating components, i.e., transmit filter, mixer, frequency synthesizer, and digital-to-analog converter

12. Optical intensity of transmitted signal Io, through a material of length z, is related to the incident intensity Ii that follows the inverse exponential power law (usually referred to as Beer–Lambert law): _$I(z) = I_ie^{−αz}$_﻿. Here _α_ is the attenuation coefficient (or linear attenuation coefficient), measured in inverse of length, e.g. _$cm^{−1}$_﻿ or $ 1/𝑐𝑚$﻿. Optical glass is of high quality if its attenuation coefficient is less $0.01 cm^{−1}$﻿. Fused or synthetic silica by any means is extremely transparent and its attenuation coefficient is less $0.00001 cm^{−1}$﻿. Work out the attenuation coefficients for them in dB/km.
    
    `$a[\text{dB}/km]=10\log(e^{a[cm^{-1}]})=\dfrac{a}{10^{-5}}[km^{-1}]10\log(e)=4.343a\cdot10^{5}[\text{dB}/km]$`﻿
    
    `_$a_{0.01cm^{−1}}[dB/km] = 4.343 ⋅ 0.01 ⋅ 105 = 4343 dB/km$_`﻿
    
    `_$a_{0.00001cm^{−1}}[dB/km] = 4.343 ⋅ 0.00001 ⋅ 105 = 4.343 dB/km$_`﻿

    `_$I(z) = I_ie^{−αz}$_`﻿
    
    `_$I(1) = I_ie^{−0.1 ⋅ 1} = 0.905I_i → 90.5\%$_`﻿
    
    `_$I(5) = I_ie^{−0.1 ⋅ 5} = 0.607I_i → 60.7\%$_`﻿

    `_$I(z) = I_i\cdot 10^{−αz/10} $_`﻿
    
    `_$I(10) = I_i\cdot10^{−0.2 ⋅ 10/10} = 0.631I_i → 63.1\%$_`﻿
    
    `_$I(50) = I_i10^{−0.2 ⋅ 50/10} = 0.1I_i → 10\%$_`﻿

16. What is macro-bending of optical fibre? How would it affect the fibre’s transmission?
    
    `Macro-bending refers to large-scale bends, which can also cause attenuation due to the loss of guided modes.`
    
    `It affects transmission by causing additional loss, particularly at wavelengths close to the cutoff wavelength.`
    
17. How micro-bending would affect a single mode optical fibre? How macro-bending would affect a single mode optical fibre?

    `Macro-bending can lead to cutoff of the mode, resulting in high loss.`
    
18. How micro-bending would affect a multimode optical fibre? How macro-bending would affect a multimode optical fibre?
    
    `In a multimode optical fiber, micro-bending can cause mode coupling and differential mode attenuation, while macro-bending can lead to loss of higher-order modes.`
    
19. Explain why the critical radius of macro-bending, $R_c$﻿, that introduces high bending loss is quite different for SM and MM optical fibres.
    
    `The critical radius of macro-bending (``$R_c$`﻿`) is different for single-mode (SM) and multimode (MM) fibers due to the different mode structures. In SM fibers, the critical radius is larger because the mode is tightly confined to the core, while in MM fibers, it is smaller due to the presence of multiple modes with different confinement properties.`
